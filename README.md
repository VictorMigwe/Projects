# Data Maverick: Data Analyst Bootcamp

The projects I created for my Data Analyst Bootcamp, plus my reflections on the courses I took leading up to each project.

You can find my curriculum [here](https://airtable.com/shr3d0a6rQa1OPL2i).

# Project 1: Python Programming

### Time Tracking Application
- The Time Tracking Application is a command-line Python program that allows users to track and manage tasks along with their elapsed times. It provides various functionalities such as;
Starting a task, stopping a task, displaying the task history, displaying the total completed time, and exporting the task history to a text file.


You can view the application [here](https://github.com/VictorMigwe/Projects/tree/main/Project1%20-%20Python%20Programming/Time%20Tracking%20Application)
